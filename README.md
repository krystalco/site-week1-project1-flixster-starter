### Walkthrough Video

`TODO://` Add the embedded URL code to your animated app walkthrough below, `ADD_EMBEDDED_CODE_HERE`. Make sure the video or gif actually renders and animates when viewing this README. (ðŸš« Remove this paragraph after adding walkthrough video)

### Reflection

- Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?
Yes, the topics in labs did assist me to complete the assignment. Lab 2 taught me a lot about how html and css work, as well as javascript query commands that I needed to use in this project.  Lab 3 taught me how to fetch data from APIs. The rest of the gaps (like CSS) could be filled in with google/stack overflow, etc. Overall, I felt Lab 2 and Lab 3 prepared me to complete this project.

- If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
If I had more time, I would have found a way to have the image flip over and give information about the movie(runtime, release date, overview, etc.). I've seen this done on other sites and thought it looks really neat and engaging. I would have had the movie-card color be seperate from the background color so that they stand out a little more. I would've liked to include a trailer for all of the movies, embedding the youtube video into eac card. Overall, I would've made the website more aesthetically pleasing with colors and effects, as well as giving the users more information about the movies.

- Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?
I didn't demo a project today, but I hope to in the future. My peers who demoed their projects did a great job. Some of my peers implemented the search feature in a way that searches through the API while the user is typing, which I think is really neat and want to do next time I have to implement a search feature. Another on of my peers, when they pressed the clear button after pressing load more, it would clear the last 20 movies instead of starting from a clean slate. I could not figure out how to do that but would like to talk to that student in case I need help with implementing a similar feature later. Lastly, my peers had very attractive a aesthetically-pleasing presentations and if I have more time I would like to experiment with different color combinations to see what looks the best but also is accessible for the reader.


### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I would shoutout Sammy (from cohort 2), I really apprciated his patient help with implementing the search function.
